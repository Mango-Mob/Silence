Carolingia (BigfooT) has nice numericals but the 9 is a bit wack.
Dragonforce might be a bit too edgy.
Pfeffer Medieval has weird number heights. Nice font however.
Ringbearer is a fanmade replica of the LOTR font.
Viking is a pog numerical font. Not too sure about the kerning.
Rise of Kingdom has a nice dash in the zero. It's pre ok.
Junicode is suuuuuuuuper nice for long paragraphs. A sleek Times New Roman.
